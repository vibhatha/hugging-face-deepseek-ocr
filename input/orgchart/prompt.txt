**Objective:** Extract all tables from the provided document.

**Context:**
- The document is a PDF containing tables with information about various ministers.
- A single page may contain the continuation of one minister's table AND the start of a completely
  new minister's table.

**Instructions:**
1. **Identify Minister:** Locate the name of the minister associated with the table(s). **Crucial:** If a page
   transitions from one minister to another, you MUST extract them as **two separate tables**. Look for bold
   headings or structural breaks indicating a new minister.
2. **Strict Row Alignment:** Each column generally has items with numbering (e.g., 1, 2, 3...). You must extract
   data such that one number refers to exactly ONE row across all columns.
   - If Column I has item "12" and Column II has no corresponding item, leave Column II **empty** for that row.
   - Do **not** compress the table; preserve the alignment based on the numbering.
   - Please extract the numbering given for each record as it is. Don't miss the numbers.
   - Ensure values per each column for each row are in order of the numbers associated with each record.
3. **Metadata Collection:** Extract metadata for each table as per the provided metadata schema.
4. **Consolidate Data:** Ensure that all records belonging to the same minister are aggregated together.
5. **Output Constraint:** 
   - You MUST output the data for each minister in a **Markdown code block** tagged as `csv`.
   - You MUST output the metadata for each table in a **Markdown code block** tagged as `json`.
   - Format:
     ```csv
     Minister, Column I, Column II, Column III
     ...
     ```
     ```json
     {
       "minister_name": "...",
       "page_number": ...
     }
     ```
   - Do NOT output HTML tables. Use CSV format inside code blocks.
