Look into the report and extract all the tables from the document. 
Extract which page each table belongs and any metadata for each table. 
I want each table extracted in csv format in a folder called csvs. 
Each table needs its metadata data in .json format and they will be in folder
metadata. All the images will be also in images folder.
